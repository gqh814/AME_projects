# Advanced Microeconometrics: Project 1 and Exam Submission

This repository contains the necessary files for **Project 1** and the **Exam Project** in Advanced Microeconometrics. The structure and contents of the repository are as follows:

### Exam Project
The `exam/main.ipynb` notebook is the primary entry point for the exam project. It calls the following Python modules:
- `estimation.py`: Implements estimation functions, including optimization methods.
- `LinearModels.py`: Contains linear modeling tools used in the analysis.
- `tobit.py`: Provides implementation for the tiboT and Tobit models.

The dataset for the exam is located in `exam/adv micro data.csv`.

### Project 1
The `project1/main.ipynb` notebook is the main entry point for Project 1. It calls the following Python modules:
- `tools.py`: Contains helper functions for data processing and model implementation.

The relevant data for Project 1 is stored in the `project1/data/` directory.

## Notes
- The Jupyter notebooks (`main.ipynb` files) serve as the primary interface, orchestrating the execution of the Python modules.
- All Python modules are used as tools to structure and organize the project code.
- Ensure the file structure remains intact for the code to run without modification.
